<img src="https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/blob/master/Images/LogoCellFie.png" width="280" height="220">

 CellFie is a computational framework to quantity a cells' metabolic functions.
 
 
 
 This framework is available as a web-based module in the list of tools of [GenePattern](www.genepattern.org). See [here](https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/wiki/Tutorial-:-GenePattern-module) information about the GenePattern module
 
 The [source code](https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/blob/master/src/CellFie.m) is running on Matlab and require the installation of the [Cobra Toolbox](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox). See [here](https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/wiki/Running-CellFie-in-Matlab) information about how to run Cellfie using Matlab
 
Detailed explanations of the methods and tools related to CellFie are available on the [wiki section](https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/wiki) of this repository
